# Onchain storage

## Contract Storage 

**Storage**: Each contract on EVM chain has storage trie that contains the values of the variables it holds. For
example, if a contract has the following:
```solidity
uint256 price;
mapping(address => uin256) balances;
```

Then the price value and all the pairs `(address,uint256)` of the mapping are stored in the storage
trie of the contract. 

:::tip
At each block, **a new trie** is created containing all the values of the variables _for this specific
block_. The root of the storage is stored in the contract information for that block.

## Historical Values as Table

The zkCoprocessor exposes the data of the contract in a very well known form: an SQL table.
More specifically, the zkCoprocessor keeps historical valuess for each block. **In a nutshell, it is a
time serie database that keeps appending the values of all variables tracked for each block.**

Let's take the previous example with the two variables `price` and `balances`. The zkCoprocessor
exposes these two variables as two separated tables:

### Table for single variables

The zkCoprocessor exposes a single table for all the different "single" variables (uint256, etc),
**not** arrays or mappings.

| Block | Price |
| ----- | ----- |
| b1    | p1    |
| b2    | p2    |

### Table for Aggregate Variables

The zkCoprocessor exposes a single table _per_ "aggregate" variable such as a mapping and arrays.

| Block | Key   | Balance |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| b1    | k1    | 10      |
| b1    | k2    | 20      |
| b2    | k1    | 15      |
| b2    | k2    | 20      |

As you can see, this table contains multiple rows **for the same block**, one for each entry in the
mapping!



:::info
The reason the tables are exposed in this way is because it is the most sensible way to expose the
historical values of a contract inside the rigid structure of SQL tables. Indeed, if one had all the
variables inside a single  table, it would look like the following:

| Block | Key   | Balance | Price |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| b1    | k1    | 10      | p1    |
| b1    | k2    | 20      | p1 (same)   |
| b2    | k1    | 15      | p2    |
| b2    | k2    | 20      | p2 (same) |

There would be useless and sometimes large repetition of elements. This is because contracts have
variables have have only one dimension (uint256) or two dimensions (arrays) or more !
