## Overview

Traditional decentralized proof marketplaces struggle with allocating resources (both demand and supply) in a way that maximizes efficiency,
affordability for proof requesters, and profitability for provers. They face potential bottlenecks when finding the optimal match between
proof requesters and provers, determining which proof requesters get their bids accepted and which provers provide the proofs, while also
setting fair prices for both sides. This leads to:

- **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Balancing supply and demand while maximizing welfare for proof requesters and provers.
- **Incentive Misalignment**: Proof requesters aim to minimize costs, while provers seek to maximize revenue, creating a conflict.
- **High Computational Costs**: ZK proofs are expensive, requiring an all-or-nothing allocation to fulfill computational demands.

## Introduction

**DARA (Double Auction Resource Allocation)** is a smart market mechanism for prover networks introduced by the Lagrange Research team to address
the unique challenges of decentralized proving marketplaces.

DARA is the first mechanism of its kind that aligns incentives across all participants. It optimizes costs for proof requesters, ensures provers
maximize revenue, and guarantees that the marketplace operates sustainably and profitably. By leveraging advanced algorithms, DARA enables
efficient resource allocation, incentivizes truthful bidding, and scales effectively to meet the growing demands of decentralized ZK proof markets.

- **Buyers (Bidders)** want a certain amount of computational power to generate proofs for their applications. They have a private value for how
  much they're willing to pay for this computation.
- **Sellers (Distributors)** have computational resources available, with each having a private cost for providing this computation based on the
  amount requested.

## How DARA Works

DARA, with its knapsack double auction mechanism, achieves the five requirements for a fair and efficient auction system:

- **Welfare Maximization: Matching Proof Requesters and Provers Efficiently**

DARA maximizes welfare for both proof requesters and provers by efficiently balancing the market. Proof requesters specify their required
computational cycles and private valuation for completing the proof, while provers indicate their available compute capacity and cost per cycle,
enabling DARA to match as many buyers and sellers as possible while ensuring optimal pairings.

A knapsack constraint ensures that proof requesters are only matched if their entire computational request can be fulfilled, as partial allocations
hold no value—making it an all-or-nothing scenario.

- **Truthfulness: Incentivizing Proof Requesters and Provers to Share Their Private Values**

DARA ensures that truthful bidding is the optimal strategy for both proof requesters and provers, avoiding inflated costs caused by unpredictable
demand. Through a threshold payment system, proof requesters pay only what is necessary to secure their computation, while provers are fairly compensated based on market costs, encouraging competitive pricing. This approach fosters a fair and efficient marketplace, enabling both small and large participants to compete equitably while optimizing resource allocation and maintaining cost-effectiveness.

- **Anti-Collusion (Weak Group-Strategy Proofness)**

In DARA, individual participants (proof requesters or provers) have no incentive to misrepresent their private valuations. Underbidding results in the
risk of losing the auction entirely, while overbidding could result in paying more than necessary or receiving insufficient computational resources.
This makes DARA weak group-strategy-proof, as even if a group attempts to collude and manipulate the auction, at least one member will find it more
advantageous to bid truthfully.

- **Computational Efficiency**

The double auction mechanism implemented by DARA ensures computational efficiency even in complex or large decentralized ecosystems. DARA maintains
consistent uptime and operates in polynomial time with near-linear complexity. This means that even as the number of buyers and sellers increases, DARA scales seamlessly, accommodating growing demand without encountering bottlenecks or significant delays.

- **Weak Budget Balance & Sustainability for the Protocol**

DARA guarantees that the protocol, which serves as the auctioneer, does not incur losses while managing the auction. Unlike conventional resource
allocation systems where the protocol might need to subsidize transactions—potentially leading to financially unsustainable operations—DARA operates
differently. It only processes proof computation bids that exceed proving costs, ensuring the protocol never has to cover transactions at a deficit.
